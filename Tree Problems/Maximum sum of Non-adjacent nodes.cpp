/*
Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node,
we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint
that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is,
if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any children in consideration and vice versa.

Input:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    /     /  \
   4     5    6
Output: 16
Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of nodes 1 4 5 6 , i.e 16
