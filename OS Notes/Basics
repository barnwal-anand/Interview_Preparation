RAM:
------
>> Programs and data that the CPU requires during execution of a program are stored in this memory.
>> Volatile memory as the data loses when the power is turned off.
>> DRAM - Capacitor based, used for main memory
>> SRAM - Faster, uses circuits like D flip-flops, used for cache

ROM:
-------
>> Stores crucial information essential to operate the system, like the program essential to boot the computer.
>> Non-volatile, useful for storing software that is rarely changed during the life of the system, also known as firmware.
