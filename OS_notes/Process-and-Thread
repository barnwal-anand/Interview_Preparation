>> Threads shares with other threads their code section, data section and
OS resources like open files and signals.
But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.

Threads operate faster than processes due to following reasons:
1) Thread creation is faster
2) Context switching between threads is much faster
3) Threads can be terminated easily
4) Communication between threads is faster
